# pi
Here we are today.  The Pi is on order.  The first bits are with us.  There is a rought recipe on how to serve
this.
** The order
  + 0 = [[./0/]]
  + 1 = [[./1/]]
  + 2 = [[./2/]]
  + 3 = [[./3/]]
  + 4 = [[./4/]]
  + 5 = [[./5/]]
  + 6 = [[./6/]]
  + 7 = [[./7/]]
  + 8 = [[./8/]]
  + 9 = [[./9/]]
  + 10 = [[./10/]]
  + 11 = [[./11/]]
  + 12 = [[./12/]]
  + 13 = [[./0xd/]]
  + 14 = [[./016/][016]], \TeX nicalities
  + 15 = [[./017/][017]], LibreELEC on the Pi
  + 16 = [[./0x10/][0x10]]: Sound, audio, compressed, encoded
  + 17 = [[./021/][021]]: Guile v3.0.7, an experimental build on the Pi Zero W
  + 18 = [[./18/][18]]: authenticate, authorize, audit
  + 19 = [[./0x13/][0x13]]: The Pi Zero W, routing between wlan0 and eth0
  + 20 = [[./20/][Arm v6 architecture]], assemble, link, run to say Hello!
  + 21 = [[./2~00010101/][2#00010101]], A cup of pi, under them numbers
  +   + 22 = [[026][026]]: iPadOS 15
  + 23 = [[8~30-1]]: GNU Guix, pull (after some time had passed)
  + 24 = [[16~18][16#18]]: Concurrency and Blue ALSA
