% 2021-07-21, gl.  The network connections as managed in LibreELEC and KODI
% Just type to get started.   A blank line ends the paragraph.
% make README.pdf - it may make the requested

http://ipv4.connman.net/online/status.html

% So, how much work is it to pasted a bit?
ConnMan sends this very minimal information in http header when doing
the online check request (example):
	Host: ipv4.connman.net
	User-Agent: ConnMan/1.23 wispr
	Connection: close

Currently following information is returned from connman.net if
the connection is successful (200 OK http response code is returned):
	Server: nginx
	Date: Mon, 09 Jun 2014 09:25:42 GMT
	Content-Type: text/html
	Connection: close
	X-ConnMan-Status: online

The X-ConnMan-Status field is used in portal detection, if it is missing
ConnMan will call RequestBrowser method in net.connman.Agent dbus
interface to handle the portal login if the portal does not support WISPr.
See doc/agent-api.txt for more details.
